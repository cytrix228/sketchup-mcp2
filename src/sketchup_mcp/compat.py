# changed response shapes), and a one-sided requirement — say, a new tool that
# calls a new Ruby handler — raises this one alone. A hotfix leaves it put,
# which is what lets a Python-only or plugin-only release talk to the
# counterpart the user already has. Releases up to 0.3.1 still cap the
# counterpart at their own version, so the first release under this rule ships
