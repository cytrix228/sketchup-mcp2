      # when this plugin needs a newer client (a contract break raises both
      # floors to that release, as in 0.3.0; a one-sided requirement raises this
      # one alone). A hotfix leaves it put. Releases up to 0.3.1 still cap the
      # counterpart at their own version, so the first release under this rule
      # ships both sides.
